DETAILED TRANSFER LOG
====================

TRANSFER 1: Pond 1 → Pond 2 (Day 30)
-------------------------------------
Trigger: Halite formation in Pond 1 after 30 days of initial evaporation
Source State: results.dat shows halite = 0.0016 mol at day 30
Transfer Volume: ~1L concentrated brine (estimated based on unit volume)
Destination: Pond 2 starts fresh operation with transferred concentrate
Result: Pond 2 operates 99 days, reaches halite = 0.0167 mol

TRANSFER 2: Pond 1 → Pond 3 (Day 76) 
-------------------------------------
Trigger: Halite formation in Pond 1 after 46 days of continued operation
Source State: results4.dat shows halite = 0.0111 mol at day 46 (relative)
Absolute Day: 30 + 46 = 76 days from simulation start
Transfer Volume: ~1L concentrated brine
Destination: Pond 3 starts operation with transferred concentrate  
Result: Pond 3 operates 99 days, reaches halite = 0.0239 mol

TRANSFER 3: Pond 1 → Pond 4 (Day 142)
--------------------------------------
Trigger: Halite formation in Pond 1 after 66 days of continued operation
Source State: results7.dat shows halite = 0.0011 mol at day 66 (relative)
Absolute Day: 76 + 66 = 142 days from simulation start
Transfer Volume: ~1L concentrated brine
Destination: Pond 4 starts operation with transferred concentrate
Result: Pond 4 operates 99 days, reaches halite = 0.0385 mol

TRANSFER 4: Pond 1 → Pond 5 (Day 187)
--------------------------------------  
Trigger: Halite formation in Pond 1 after 45 days of continued operation
Source State: results10.dat shows halite = 0.0128 mol at day 45 (relative)
Absolute Day: 142 + 45 = 187 days from simulation start
Transfer Volume: ~1L concentrated brine
Destination: Pond 5 starts operation with transferred concentrate
Result: Pond 5 operates 99 days, reaches halite = 0.0385 mol

TRANSFER 5: Pond 1 → Pond 6 (Day 218)
--------------------------------------
Trigger: Halite formation in Pond 1 after 31 days of continued operation  
Source State: results13.dat shows halite = 0.0367 mol at day 31 (relative)
Absolute Day: 187 + 31 = 218 days from simulation start
Transfer Volume: ~1L concentrated brine
Destination: Pond 6 starts operation with transferred concentrate
Result: Pond 6 operates 99 days, reaches halite = 0.0385 mol

VOLUME CALCULATIONS:
===================
Note: The simulation assumes unit volumes (1L) for computational purposes.
In a real system, volumes would be calculated based on:
- Pond areas (from pondsData.txt)
- Operating levels
- Transfer ratios between ponds

For actual volumes, multiply results by:
Volume_real = halite_moles × pond_area_m2 × operating_depth_m × 1000 L/m3

SEASONAL RATE IMPACT:
====================
Transfer timing is influenced by seasonal evaporation rates:
- Day 30: Early autumn rates (0.19-0.40 mol/day/L)
- Day 76: Mid-autumn rates (0.24 mol/day/L average)  
- Day 142: Late autumn/early winter rates (0.15 mol/day/L average)
- Day 187: Winter/spring transition rates (0.31 mol/day/L average)
- Day 218: Spring rates (0.35 mol/day/L average, capped)

The variable scheduling creates realistic seasonal timing for transfers,
with faster concentration in high-evaporation periods and slower progress
during low-evaporation winter months.
