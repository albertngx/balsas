POND-BY-POND ANALYSIS
=====================

POND 1 (Primary Concentrator)
------------------------------
Role: Continuous operation, feeds all other ponds
Operating Pattern: Cycles of concentration → transfer → restart

Cycle 1 (Days 0-30): results.dat
- Duration: 30 days  
- Final halite: 0.0016 mol
- Outcome: Transfer to Pond 2

Cycle 2 (Days 30-76): results3.dat + results4.dat  
- Duration: 46 days total (100 days results3.dat, 46 days results4.dat to transfer point)
- Final halite: 0.0111 mol
- Outcome: Transfer to Pond 3

Cycle 3 (Days 76-142): results6.dat + results7.dat
- Duration: 66 days total (100 days results6.dat, 66 days results7.dat to transfer point)  
- Final halite: 0.0011 mol (note: lower due to seasonal rates)
- Outcome: Transfer to Pond 4

Cycle 4 (Days 142-187): results9.dat + results10.dat
- Duration: 45 days total (100 days results9.dat, 45 days results10.dat to transfer point)
- Final halite: 0.0128 mol
- Outcome: Transfer to Pond 5

Cycle 5 (Days 187-218): results12.dat + results13.dat  
- Duration: 31 days (100 days results12.dat, 31 days results13.dat to transfer point)
- Final halite: 0.0367 mol
- Outcome: Transfer to Pond 6

POND 2 (First Receiver)
-----------------------
Operation: results2.dat (Days 30-129)
- Receives: Concentrated brine from Pond 1 at day 30
- Duration: 99 days of evaporation
- Final halite: 0.0167 mol
- Status: Moderate concentration achieved

POND 3 (Second Receiver)  
------------------------
Operation: results5.dat (Days 76-175)
- Receives: Concentrated brine from Pond 1 at day 76
- Duration: 99 days of evaporation
- Final halite: 0.0239 mol  
- Status: Higher concentration than Pond 2

POND 4 (Third Receiver)
-----------------------
Operation: results8.dat (Days 142-241)
- Receives: Concentrated brine from Pond 1 at day 142
- Duration: 99 days of evaporation
- Final halite: 0.0385 mol
- Status: High concentration achieved

POND 5 (Fourth Receiver)
------------------------
Operation: results11.dat (Days 187-286)
- Receives: Concentrated brine from Pond 1 at day 187  
- Duration: 99 days of evaporation
- Final halite: 0.0385 mol
- Status: High concentration achieved

POND 6 (Fifth Receiver)
-----------------------
Operation: results14.dat (Days 218-317)
- Receives: Concentrated brine from Pond 1 at day 218
- Duration: 99 days of evaporation
- Final halite: 0.0385 mol
- Status: High concentration achieved

HALITE PROGRESSION ANALYSIS:
============================
Clear progression showing system efficiency:

Early Ponds (2-3): Moderate halite formation
- Pond 2: 0.0167 mol (receiving less concentrated feed)
- Pond 3: 0.0239 mol (receiving more concentrated feed)

Later Ponds (4-6): Maximum halite formation  
- Ponds 4-6: All reach 0.0385 mol (optimal concentration)
- Shows system reaching steady-state performance

SEASONAL IMPACT ON OPERATIONS:
==============================
Each pond operates during different seasonal periods:

Pond 2 (Days 30-129): Autumn → Winter transition
- Benefits from higher autumn evaporation rates initially
- Slows during winter period

Pond 3 (Days 76-175): Late autumn → Winter → Early spring
- Mixed seasonal conditions
- Shows adaptation to seasonal variation

Ponds 4-6 (Days 142-317): Winter → Spring → Early summer
- All experience similar seasonal progression  
- Achieve consistent high concentrations
- Demonstrates system robustness across seasons

SYSTEM EFFICIENCY INDICATORS:
=============================
✓ Progressive concentration increase (0.0167 → 0.0239 → 0.0385 mol)
✓ Consistent performance in later ponds (4-6 all reach 0.0385 mol)
✓ Adaptation to seasonal evaporation variation
✓ Stable transfer timing despite rate variations
✓ No operational failures or convergence issues
